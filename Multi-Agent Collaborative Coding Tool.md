```

**Components:**

*   **Prompt UI Toolbox Frontend:** This will be the primary user interface, adapted to display three concurrent chat windows, each linked to a live terminal instance. It will handle user input (text and voice), display terminal output, and manage the visual presentation of the collaborative coding environment.

*   **Whisper ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition):** Integrated into the frontend, Whisper will convert spoken voice commands from the human user into text, which will then be processed by the frontend and sent to the backend.

*   **Backend Server:** A central application responsible for orchestrating the entire system. It will manage WebSocket connections, host the AI agents, and provide an interface to the live terminal environments. It will also handle the routing of commands and data between the frontend, AI agents, and terminals.

*   **Live Terminal Environments (3 instances):** Each AI agent will operate within its own isolated live terminal environment. These environments will provide actual command-line capabilities, including the ability to run NPX commands and access the local directory. This isolation ensures that each agent\'s operations do not interfere with others.

*   **AI Agents (PM, Frontend, Backend):** These are the intelligent entities responsible for performing coding tasks. They will receive instructions from the human user (via the frontend) and communicate with each other using the MCP protocol. Their actions will be executed within their respective live terminal environments.

*   **WebSocket Communication:** A persistent, bi-directional communication channel between the frontend and the backend server. This will be crucial for real-time updates, such as streaming terminal output to the frontend and sending user commands to the backend.

*   **MCP Protocol:** The Model Context Protocol will serve as the standardized communication layer between the AI agents. This protocol will enable agents to share context, exchange code snippets, coordinate tasks, and collaborate on coding efforts in a structured manner.

### 4.2. AI Instances and Integration

The application will support three instances of AI code models, specifically Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude. The user\'s request for `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` and `npx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli` indicates a preference for command-line interface (CLI) based interaction with these models. The GUI will abstract these CLI interactions, providing a user-friendly experience.

*   **Gemini Code Integration:** Integration will leverage the `gemini-cli` for code generation, completion, and refactoring tasks. Each Gemini instance will be configured to operate within its designated agent role (e.g., Frontend, Backend).
*   **Claude Code Integration:** Integration will utilize `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` for similar code-related functionalities, offering an alternative or complementary AI model for code generation and analysis. This provides flexibility and potentially better results for specific coding challenges.

### 4.3. GUI Support

The GUI will be a critical component, providing a visual and interactive environment for collaborative coding. Key features of the GUI include:

*   **Multi-Terminal View:** As depicted in the user\'s image, the GUI will feature three side-by-side terminal-like windows, each dedicated to an AI agent. This allows human users to monitor the real-time output and actions of each agent simultaneously.
*   **Code Editor Integration:** A built-in code editor with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and version control integration will allow human users to review, modify, and commit code directly within the application.
*   **MCP Command Input/Output:** The GUI will provide a clear interface for human users to input MCP commands and view the structured output from the AI agents, facilitating direct control and monitoring of inter-agent communication.
*   **Task Management Dashboard:** A visual dashboard to track the progress of tasks assigned to each agent, including task status, assigned agent, and completion percentage.
*   **Chat Interface:** A chat interface for human users to communicate with individual AI agents or broadcast messages to all agents, enabling natural language interaction and guidance.

### 4.4. MCP Protocol Command Changing

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) will be central to enabling dynamic and collaborative interactions between the AI agents. MCP will be used for:

*   **Context Sharing:** Agents will share relevant code snippets, task descriptions, and project context via MCP to ensure all agents have a unified understanding of the current state.
*   **Command Execution:** Human users and AI agents can issue MCP commands to other agents to request specific actions, such as generating code for a particular module, refactoring a function, or debugging an issue.
*   **Collaborative Decision Making:** Agents can propose solutions or suggest changes via MCP, and other agents (or the human user) can approve or modify these proposals, fostering a collaborative development process.
*   **Dynamic Role Assignment:** While initial roles are PM, Frontend, and Backend, the MCP could potentially allow for dynamic reassignment of tasks or even temporary role-swapping between agents based on project needs.
